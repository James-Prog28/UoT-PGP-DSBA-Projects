Project 6: Credit Card Users Churn Prediction

Project Score Recieved: 60/60

Brief Project Description: A bank sees decline in the number of customers using their credit cards, so bank wants to know the reasons behind the same and predict if a person will attrite or not

Objective:	
	1. Explore and visualize the dataset
	2. Build a classification model to predict if the customer is going to churn or not
	3. Optimize the model using appropriate techniques
  4. Identify the best possible model that will give the required performance
  5. Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the bank
  6. Using the template provide, create a business presentation as you would present to management/business leaders

Skills and Tools: EDA Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, Up and Down Sampling, Regularization, Model Building, and Hyperparameter Tuning

Full Project Description - Background & Context:  
The Thera bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card, credit cards are a good source of income for banks because of different kinds of fees charged by the banks like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, and others. Some fees are charged to every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.

Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas

You as a Data scientist at Thera bank need to come up with a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards

You need to identify the best possible model that will give the required performance

Submission Guidelines - There are two parts to the submission: 
	1. A well commented Jupyter notebook [format - .html]
	2. Using the template provide, create a PowerPoint business presentation as you would present to management/business leaders [format - .pdf]
